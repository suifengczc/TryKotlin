/*
Comparison
Read about operator overloading to learn how different conventions for operations like ==, <, + work in Kotlin. Add the function compareTo to the class MyDate to make it comparable. After that the code below date1 < date2 will start to compile.

In Kotlin when you override a member, the modifier override is mandatory.
